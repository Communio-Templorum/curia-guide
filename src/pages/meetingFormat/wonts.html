<h2>Wonts</h2>
<p>Wonts embody the spiritual customs necessary for the healthy functioning of each Curiae.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Our leaders are but trusted servants; they do not govern.</li>
	<li>Curiae are open to all who wish to serve the Gods of the Romans or to learn more about our religion, customs, and practices.</li>
	<li>Each Curia should be autonomous except in matters affecting other Curiae or the Communio Templorum Romanorum as a whole.</li>
	<li>Each Curia has but two primary purposesâ€”to serve the Gods and to serve their communities.</li>
	<li>A Curia ought never endorse, finance, or lend the name of the Communio Templorum Romanorum to any facility or outside enterprise, lest problems of money, property, and prestige divert us from our primary purposes.</li>
	<li>Every Curia ought to be fully self-supporting.</li>
	<li>Our public relations policy is based on attraction rather than promotion.</li>
</ol>
