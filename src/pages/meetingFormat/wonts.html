<h2>Wonts</h2>
<p>Wonts embody the spiritual customs necessary for the healthy functioning of our Curiae.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Our leaders are but trusted servants; they do not govern.</li>
	<li>Curiae are open to all who wish to serve the Gods of the Romans or to learn more about our religion, customs, and practices.</li>
	<li>Each Curia should be autonomous except in matters affecting other Curiae or the Communio Templorum Romanorum as a whole.</li>
	<li>Each Curia has but two primary purposesâ€”to serve the Gods and to serve their communities.</li>
</ol>
